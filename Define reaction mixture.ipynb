    "The above code regularly needs input of information about the experiment, which might come from asking a user, or perhaps something like parsing an EnzymeML file. The input is actually obtained by the various Python functions (most of which are still to be implemented!). As far as I can see the only basic sub-program element available in Python is the function defined by def – although this is clearly much more versatile than functions in some other languages. Most of the functions are currently coded as returning nothing as a formal result. They would actually each obtain several attributes of an experiment, although perhaps these could be packaged into a Python data structure and returned as one result. But perhaps they just have to put values obtained into global variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "So my key question, on which I would like advice from those more expert in Python, is the best data structure(s) to use for the attributes that make up the metadata of a given experiment. In each case there will be a series of required attributes, selected from a larger comprehensive list of attributes that may sometimes be needed. These attribute values are of a wide variety of types, including real numbers with units, text strings, booleans (e.g. single phase?), selections from a restricted list (e.g. batch, fed-batch, continuous), integers (e.g. number of impellers), database references, chemical structure diagrams, time programs (e.g. for temperature or pH). \n",
    "\n",
    "Would we use some of the data types available to construct something comparable to a database record?  Would each experiment be best recorded as an instance of a Python Class? Or something else? \n",
    "\n",
    "I also have some worries about the use of global variables for this purpose. Of course Python allows the function to alter global variables used in other parts of the code. And it seems to me, as a beginner, that this is standard practice. But is there some convention of good practice that reduces the risk of the problem with extensive code – that something in one function alters variables used elsewhere that it’s not supposed to change (according to its stated job). You will perhaps recognise here the concern of someone brought up on Pascal, where global variables should be used only very sparingly, and the definition of a function or procedure sets out explicitly what variables it is allowed to change. Python is not restrictive like this, but to avoid problems in writing the code that calls a function, I think there has to be very clear specification of which metadata values each function is allowed to alter, and as much protection as possible to stop it accidentally altering others.\n",
